#The roadmap with planned features for future releases

= Roadmap =

reasonable ones in possible future updates. The following list is always work in progress, features may be pushed around or be dropped again.


Note that _italic_ items are considered useful, but have to be further evaluated first. Items that have been ~~striked through~~ have been dropped *or* moved to another release. Please use the comment function to suggest other features.
