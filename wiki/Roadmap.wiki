#The roadmap with planned features for future releases

= Roadmap =

The ideas of how to improve eponyms keep coming in, and of course I'll include the best and 
reasonable ones in possible future updates. The following list is always work in progress, features may be pushed around or be dropped again.


Note that _italic_ items are considered useful, but have to be further evaluated first. Items that have been ~~striked through~~ have been dropped *or* moved to another release


== 1.1 ==

  * Spelled-out category names
  * Starring/Flagging eponyms
  * Monthly auto-check for new eponyms


== 1.2 ==

  * _Fulltext search_ (currently, only the title is being searched)


== x.x ==

  * _German translation_
