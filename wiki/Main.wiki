= Eponyms =

This Application brings the beautiful eponym database from _Andrew J. Yee_ (http://www.eponyms.net/) to your iPhone or iPod touch.
The database currently contains *more than 1'600 medical eponyms* and is updated from time to time. The app will be able to download updated eponyms without having to update the whole application.

You can browse all eponyms or only eponyms of a given category, and there is live searching. Use the app in portrait or landscape mode as you wish.

Due to Apples policy, the application is only downloadable from the *iTunes Store*. There will be two versions, which are identical down to the code. One will be available for 2 US Dollars and the other one - the Student Edition - for free. Please do only download the free version when you still are a student.
