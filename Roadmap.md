#The roadmap with planned features for future releases

# Roadmap #

The ideas of how to improve eponyms keep coming in, and of course I'll include the best and

Note that _italic_ items are considered useful, but have to be further evaluated first. Items that have been ~~striked through~~ have been dropped **or** moved to another release. Please use the comment function to suggest other features.
